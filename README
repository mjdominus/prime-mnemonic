Purpose: We want to memorize all the primes up to 1000.

Idea: There are at most 4 primes per decade
  (which is a sequence 10n .. 10n + 9)
  Each decade can be represented by 4 bits.
  Map 4 bits to an English consontant.
  Then 100 decades corresponds to 100 consonants,
  which we can embed in around 40 words.
  These 40 words for a mnemonic for the primes.
